    <p>I have a router that runs LEDE. It has 115 firewall rules. I made
these by typing stanzas of about eight lines each into a file
<cite>/etc/config/firewall</cite>. Not great, not bad. I've already <a class="reference external" href="/netconf-and-the-curse-of-consensus.html">held forth</a> on this some. But now the
path of least resistance for deploying web apps on my own
infrastructure seems to be to create jails on a FreeBSD system
(statically setting their IPv6 addresses), (security hardening
handwaving), and add a firewall rule to allow access to a jail from
some zone (e.g. my LAN, the Internet). This is now an orchestratey
kind of task. And in between my earlier rant and now, I've used
Ansible some.</p>
<p>There's an Ansible role to set the firewall configuration on an
OpenWRT routerâ€”but it only sets the entire configuration. To do this
orchestratey task, I would need to use <tt class="docutils literal">uci</tt> to make the edit. But
<tt class="docutils literal">uci</tt>, when you are setting something like a firewall rule, lets you
list all the things, add or remove a thing, and reorder things, but it
doesn't help you order them, for example by saying &quot;this one should go
after the one that has such-and-such set to so-and-so.&quot; Perhaps
NETCONF will save everything? I've been reading that Ansible is
ramping up support for it. But it's awful!</p>
<p>In the meantime, I've been using BSD more, and I sort of want it on my
router, if it's so much better designed or has a much nicer packet
filter or something. But BSD on routers seems to be sort of an x86
thing, like you get a desktop computer, put multiple network cards in
it, and voila; or you get a PCEngines board. It seems NetBSD won't run
on my MIPS-based router (specifically) while FreeBSD will (!?), and
FreeBSD for my router has nothing like the customization OpenWRT/LEDE
has, where entire subsystems of a usual desktop/server OS have been
removed and replaced with smaller, more purpose-built ones (glibc,
systemd, dbus, NetworkManager, firewalld, ISC dhcpd, etc.). It looks
like NetBSD has a flash-specific filesystem (CHFS) for a while now,
and a way to statically link a whole bunch of binaries into a single
file and make the different subsumed commands runnable using
hardlinks. I have no idea of the relative merits of NPF vs. any of
FreeBSD's <cite>three</cite> packet filtering systems vs. iptables.</p>
<p>Somebodyoughta make a router OS out of a BSD, and stick 9P support in
it, and use Rust or Go or something for all the new hotness that gets
added.</p>
