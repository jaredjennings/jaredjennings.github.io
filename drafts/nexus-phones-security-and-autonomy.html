    <p>This is a complaint, so I'll try to keep it short. Nexus phones were
originally made for developers. They were easily unlockable and
rootable. You could put any OS on them. This got more difficult with the
Nexus 5, and it's hard enough with the Nexus 5X that I couldn't manage
it in one night.</p>
