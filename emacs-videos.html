    <p>Xah has started to post videos on his Emacs blog. And I
watched &quot;playing Emacs like an instrument,&quot; and watched part of
the Emacs Chat episode with Xah, and &quot;the editor of a lifetime.&quot;</p>
<p>I've also listened to many Emacs Chat episodes as podcasts, audio
only. Now I can say that watching people use Emacs fluidly has
made me want to make my Emacs nicer in a way that only listening
didn't. It's uncanny.</p>
<p>Today I started to try to make Emacs generate tags files, so that
jumping to the definition of something from a call to it will
work right. I did it by pasting code, then found out that there
have since been packages made that make it nicer.</p>
<p>I've been annoyed to have to use C-x C-b to list my buffers
because Xah didn't make a keyboard shortcut for it, but watching
his command-log scroll by on his video I saw he uses IBuffer, and
he did make a keyboard shortcut for that, and it's much better. I
had no idea!</p>
