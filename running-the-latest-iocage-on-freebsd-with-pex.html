  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>While trying to move iocage jails from one machine to another, I found
that iocage import tries to read its entire input into RAM, in the
version of iocage I had installed via pkg(1). Furthermore, I <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/iocage/iocage/issues/1086#issuecomment-809902293">found</a>
that the problem had been fixed already, but that no iocage release
had been made that contained the fix, for more than a year. So no one
has packaged a version of iocage that contains the fix.</p>
<p>I didn't really want to install the latest iocage and scatter files
over my system: not least because if it's no good, I want to be able
to remove it easily.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git clone https://github.com/iocage/iocage
cd iocage
python3 -m venv ve
source ve/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
# it will bomb out because build/.../wheel/iocage_lib does not exist
mkdir # build/.../wheel
mkdir # build/.../wheel/iocage_lib
mkdir # build/.../wheel/iocage_cli
# that was a kluge within a kluge
deactivate
python3 -m venv pexve
source pexve/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pex
pex -v -m iocage_cli:cli -o iocage-sac \
    -r requirements.txt \
    ./dist/iocage_cli-1.2-py3-none-any.whl \
    ./dist/iocage_lib-1.2-py3-none-any.whl
</pre>
<p>The result is a single file, iocage-sac, which contains all of iocage
and its dependencies, but not Python. I placed it in /usr/local/bin.</p>
<p>Not having an installed copy of iocage means I don't have the rc
script installed, so my jails don't start on boot. That would be a
small matter of scripting, but I haven't bothered with it yet.</p>
