<p>I built Firefox OS (or Boot2Gecko; are they still calling it that when
it doesn't come straight from Mozilla?) for my Nexus 4 phone. It boots
fast, it runs well, and I used it for a couple of days. It's a great
piece of software and it's getting better all the time. You should try
it.</p>
<p>Firefox OS is targeted at people buying their first smartphone, in
places where a phone that costs $100 to build is an expensive phone.
While it has the capability to download an app which will then run
offline, mostly what it does is to get you in contact with the websites
that already serve the content and capability you need. The icons you
tap on the home screen are actually mostly bookmarks. This works better
than you might think.</p>
<p>The Nexus 4 is a <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Firefox_OS_build_prerequisites">Tier 3
device</a>
for Firefox OS, meaning that someone got it to build once, but core
developers are not actively working every day to make it great. So the
Nexus 4 has an LED flash on its back camera, but the Tier 1 devices
don't, so the camera app doesn't do flash support, and the flashlight
app works by turning the screen all white. I think there may be some
quirks to the touch screens on Tier 1 devices, because on my phone
scrolling doesn't always quite work right. Little things like that.</p>
<p>The big thing is that the Mozilla podcast app has hiccups in playback. I
listen to podcasts while driving to work and back, and these
interruptions distract me. I've had one car accident in my life because
I was distracted by electronics; and one is enough.</p>
<p>Back over in Android-land, the Nexus 4 is a tier-one device, and
Podkicker Pro is a dependable podcasting app. Safety and comfort.</p>
<p>The reason I wish I could stay on Firefox OS is because all of the
software that runs on the server side, and makes things like contact
backups and the app store possibleâ€”it's all open-source software. I
could control my phone's entire ecosystem. That is a power with which
Google does not trust me.</p>
<p>I feel bad pointing out weaknesses that I could possibly fix instead of
complaining and leaving, but the best I can do right now is say that
somebodyoughta make it better. Oh, and add Bluetooth keyboard support
too.</p>
