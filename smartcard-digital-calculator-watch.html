    <p>I like smartcards. They can be quite secure, and they are simple to use,
given all the right hardware and software. But to buy a small quantity
of ISO 7816 smartcards seems quite expensive, compared to buying some
microcontroller chips that purport to fill some of the same functions.
Smartcards are quite small and portable compared to laptops, but not
compared to smartphones. A smartcard reader made for a smartphone
appears <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/BlackBerry-Bluetooth-Smart-Reader-Blackberry/dp/B00169TIAM%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q%26tag%3Dduckduckgo-d-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00169TIAM">quite
expensive</a>,
$100 or more. And these days I want my smartcard reader to have a pinpad
so my PIN cannot so easily be keylogged; readers with pinpads don't seem
to be cheap or small.</p>
<p>So: <strong>somebodyoughta</strong> take a cheap smartcard chip, mash it together
with a USB card reader having both A and micro-B plugs, and put a little
pinpad on the outside, like those digital calculator watches from the
90s. Then I could have portable, secure key storage for any of my
computing devices.</p>
<p><strong>Edited to add (1 June 2014)</strong>: I forgot about the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey-neo/">Yubikey</a>,
and while I wasn't thinking about it they made one with NFC. It emits
one-time passwords, rather than holding private keys, but it already
exists as a product, and can be had for $50, unlike my notional device.
Somebody still oughta.</p>
