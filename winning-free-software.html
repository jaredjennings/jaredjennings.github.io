</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I've worried a lot lately rather than coding. I haven't got that much
time to do either of them, so it's important to make sure that the
coding I do helps people or has lasting merit. Or at least it seems like
that.</p>
<p>This means I haven't got time to improve operating systems for mobile
phones: by the time I did something good the phone would be obsolete.
WebOS and Hellaphone, out the window. It means I haven't got time for
Clojure, because to be effective all the software I wrote in that
language would be GPL-incompatible. I can't use niche software, because
nobody's watching for security bugs in it. And if I write some niche
software, it's not helping the world nearly as much as I thought,
because the world hasn't found it, and because it only helps people who
already know how to use computers, i.e. white dudes my age. What I have
released (CMITS) has lost to other things that were covered by press
releases, like SIMP and SCAP. No mindshare, no community, no progress,
lose.</p>
<p>Maybe if I find a LUG or some makers to hang out with, instead of just
reading tech news all the time, things will get better.</p>
