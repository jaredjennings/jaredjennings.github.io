    <p>I'm trying to split my IT estate across two floors of my house. The
present plan for that entails some kind of low-powered device
upstairs, and the muscle in the basement.</p>
<p>I found an Asus mini PC with an Intel Core i3, 8 GB RAM, and two video
outputs, for cheaper than a Raspberry Pi 4, considering the case and
SSD I'd need for the Pi 4. I was waffling about it. Then I found an
Asus Chromebox with an Intel Core i3, 4 GB RAM, a 16GB SSD, and two
video outputs, for cheaper than the Pi 4. I bit. For that price I
could afford to be wrong.</p>
<p>So far I've found that even Chromeboxes with x86 processors are not
quite PCs in the sense I expected, and it's all to do with what
happens at boot time. I did manage to install the TianoCore-based
MrChromebox UEFI firmware, and I'm able to start executing all sorts
of OSes that have EFI bootloaders. But not nearly all of them end up
working. Enough experiences have accumulated that I need to dump them
here.</p>

<dd>I had to unplug and replug the thumbdrive for the installer to
be able to find it, and there are some odd messages to do with the
mouse during boot, but graphics, input, storage and networking do
seem to work. I'm pretty sure nothing is optimized though. I run
a lot of CAD lately; both CGAL (underneath OpenSCAD) and OpenCascade
(underneath FreeCAD, to say nothing of Qt) require C++, which is
nowhere to be found in the Plan 9 universe, and I'm not certain
that the VNC viewer will push pixels fast enough for me. Also the
ssh client appears not to support public keys.</dd>

<dd>Boot screen with light-up icons shows; they fly by, but then the
machine reboots.</dd>
<dt>NetBSD 9.2, FreeBSD 13.0, Dragonfly 6.0</dt>
<dd>All three of these hang at boot just after showing &quot;EFI framebuffer
information.&quot; It appears there is <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=209821">a FreeBSD bug filed about it</a>, and even
a patch under review. If I had stronger build-fu, I could build a
FreeBSD install thumbdrive with the patched loader.</dd>
<dt>OpenBSD 6.9</dt>
<dd>Downloaded the USB image; didn't try it. I think I don't like Theo.</dd>
<dt>Debian GNU/Linux 10.10</dt>
<dd>Installer boots nicely. Network card (rtl8169 was it?) requires
nonfree firmware. Wait, on a second install it didn't require the
firmware?? Anyway ChromeOS is Linux, so this machine will run Linux
well.</dd>
<dt>Fedora</dt>
<dd>I haven't liked the way Red Hat does open-source software for a
while. They start or join projects that make the software that the
company needs for its products, and they make the code grow, but
maybe not the project. The result is a piece of software with
poorly stated goals, little or no useful documentation, and a weak
community. It's only really useful and dependable when you buy the
Red Hat product. And it's summarily dropped the moment the
company's strategy no longer includes it. Fine decisions for a
company to make—maybe even not as bad as some other open-source
strip mining that goes on—but I'm not inclined to help them.</dd>
