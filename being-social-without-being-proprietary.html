    <p>I'm annoyed at the app-centric world that most people live in nowadays.
The FSF wants my help in <a class="reference external" href="https://defectivebydesign.org/show-them-the-world-is-watching-stop-drm-in-html">protesting the
Hollyweb</a>,
and Dave Winer and Hossein Derakhshan are on about <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/&#64;davewiner/please-please-post-this-on-your-blog-d21ebd28b929#.w2vffdn13">the web we have to
save</a>
(&quot;Log in to Medium to recommend this story!&quot;). I've been annoyed for a
long time that if you say <a class="reference external" href="http://imgur.com/blablabla">http://imgur.com/blablabla</a> on Twitter, you get
a picture in your post, but if you say <a class="reference external" href="http://instagram.com/blablabla">http://instagram.com/blablabla</a>,
you don't. I read about Diaspora when it was announced, and even tried
to hack on some other Ruby federated social networking thing, back when
I had the idea of sharing the links you find inside the Bible, and
between the Bible and things people think or say, using RDF. Today I
looked again at StatusNet (which has become GNU Social), pump.io,
activity streams, OSomethingorother, and etc. and found a nice, sobering
post about how <a class="reference external" href="https://simsa01.wordpress.com/2015/12/10/some-reasons-perhaps-not-to-join-gnu-social-and-the-fediverse/">it isn't all sunshine and
roses</a>.
Good to know without having to find out first. Of course, the network
effects alone are sobering in their strength. One reason to follow
people on Twitter is to find people who are much different than me, and
those people are not going to set up Pump.io instances any time soon. Do
they have more power to speak because they are findable, or less because
the medium they are using constricts them to sound bites and me to a
grunt of approval? More because they aren't long-form journalists, or
less because I can't link to them easily enough?</p>
