    <p>I've learned a few things. First, a firewall misconfiguration was
partly to blame. Second, neither Alpine's nginx package, nor netcat as
found in Debian, appear to support IPv6. The dhcp daemon can be
written into a systemd unit; I haven't done it yet. DNS updates might
happen if I were to serve DHCPv6 from my dnsmasq instance; I haven't
tried it yet. And acbuild is easy and quick to start using.</p>
