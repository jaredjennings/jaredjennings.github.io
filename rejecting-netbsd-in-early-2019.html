    <p>I've got this Dell Latitude E4300 laptop. The battery has stopped
working long ago, but the computer hasn't. I had FreeBSD on it, with
UFS, and maybe the power went out, or maybe I shut it down wrong, but
it ceased to be able to boot. So I put NetBSD on. Here is what I've
found and why I'm quitting using it. Note that these are things I
could have done something about. The first thing is to say what they
are though. And these are all pkgsrc, not NetBSD, issues.</p>
<p>The Firefox (64.0.2) in pkgsrc depends on libicui18n, and this library
got upgraded to a new major soversion 63, but Firefox wasn't built
against it, so suddenly after an upgrade my browser didn't work.</p>
<p>mozilla-rootcerts is a way to get the normal root certs trusted. Not a
very integrated way, but - it puts root certs under
/etc/openssl/certs, and has for some ten years, while dillo is
hardcoded to look under /etc/ssl. Dillo's code has a comment
suggesting they know they need to get better at finding the root
certs, more flexible, but they haven't.</p>
<p>OpenJDK is in pkgsrc; good. But Arduino is not. And when I try to
build it myself, the build works (once I get GNU tar to be the tar
used... I just made a symlink /usr/pkg/bin/tar pointing at
/usr/pkg/bin/gtar, and put /usr/pkg/bin at the front of PATH), but
running fails with some odd shared library error. (Note that I
casually dropped the term <cite>soversion</cite> above. It wanted four of
something but only had two. I've seen many shared library errors, but
never the likes of this one.)</p>
<p>NetBSD was capable of sending my laptop to sleep, but not waking it
again. Eh.</p>
<p>So that's why I'm quitting NetBSD at this time. Maybe I'll be back,
but you see I've just finished this 3-D printer and I have to build
its firmware (which has no Makefile so I have to use Arduino)
post-haste. Back to FreeBSD.</p>
<p>EDITED TO ADD: FreeBSD didn't work for Arduino either and I went back
to Debian. Since then my Kerberos server, which was running Debian on
a Raspberry Pi, died. I replaced it with NetBSD. I had to install
OpenLDAP from pkgsrc, but I was pleased to find that the Kerberos in
the base system serves fine.</p>
