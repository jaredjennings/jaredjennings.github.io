    <p>Here's a list of things I want to improve about xah-fly-keys in spring 2018. (In September 2017, I didn't know some things I know now.) To-dos not gripes.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">s</tt> does not work like Vi's <tt class="docutils literal">o</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">O</tt>, but like Emacs'
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C-o</span></tt>. When I open a line, I want what's on the line I have my
cursor on to move down a line, not to split a line. I have a
function that does this but making it happen when I press <tt class="docutils literal">s</tt> is
a matter of hacking up <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xah-fly-keys.el</span></tt>, or waiting for the
change Xah has said he wants to make, where keymaps are switched
not rewritten when modes change.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">c</tt> does not work like <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt>, in that it does not include the
newline at the end when run without the mark active (i.e.,
linewise). Because of this I don't even use <tt class="docutils literal">c</tt>. That leads to
other problems.</li>
<li>The amount of precision and subtlety devoted to moving is
different than that devoted to copying or deleting. I <em>love</em> the
<tt class="docutils literal">ijkl</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">uo</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">h;</tt>, and other movement keys I haven't
learned to use. I've rejected ergoemacs in large part because its
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">M-h</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">M-S-h</span></tt> are so much worse than <tt class="docutils literal">h</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">;</tt>. But
half the time when I want to delete a word with <tt class="docutils literal">e</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">r</tt>, I
end up nuking half my document instead, because the mark was set,
which I didn't know about and can't see, and <tt class="docutils literal">e</tt> deletes the
region <em>plus a word</em>. Also nearly every time I type <tt class="docutils literal">g</tt>, I was not
trying to delete a paragraph. I think the solution here is to
learn to use the mark more intentionally. But—</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">e</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">r</tt> do something different if the mark is set, but
<tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">c</tt> only do something different if the mark is
activated. <em>EDIT</em>: everything works right in transient-mark-mode.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>To really do this up right, I need to record all my commands and see
what I do most often—i.e., do the same legwork Xah did. The immediate
thing to do with such knowledge would be to move commands around
between keybindings. The deeper thing to do would be to look at
sequences of commands and ask how they could become single
commands. This should include looking at things I do, then undo, and
asking why they didn't work right.</p>
<p>But this amount of introspection about text editing is a level of
detail I don't usually want to descend to. It already takes me too
long to figure out what I really need to say, without also thinking
about how to type it.</p>
