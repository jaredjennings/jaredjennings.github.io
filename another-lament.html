  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>After booting up the Hurd in a VM (it works, and thanks to Debian has
lots of software, but no 64-bit, no NX-protection, and no community to
add them), and poking through editors provided by pkgsrc in NetBSD, I
came upon conglomerate, an attempt to make structured,
non-WYSIWYG-but-graphical document editing, specifically in XML and
mostly with DocBook, something that anyone could do. Last touched in
2005, stored in CVS, built against Gnome 2.4.</p>
<p>This, after speaking with an old colleague about my own project in
structured documentation, CMITS, and the visions I had for its future,
where it would no longer be confined to a single big document, nor yet
to a single system configuration management product—but, as I couldn't
see at the time, would likely have ended up confined to a single
implementer.</p>
<p>Compound this with a tour through Advogato, Kuro5hin, and Everything2,
and the same sense of loss now pervades as I used to feel after
reading papers and books about RDF, all several years old, all excited
about the future where we would share more and know more—and, after
that, nothing.</p>
